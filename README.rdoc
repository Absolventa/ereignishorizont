Welcome to Event Girl!

Event Girl is an open event-logging system 
with triggers/hooks to run arbitrary tasks when an event is 
matched or not matched.  

It was proposed as a project for the Rails Girls Summer of Code. 
Its two main contributors are the Rails Girls Susanne and Tam who 
will be working on the project from July 2 - September 30, 2013
at the ABSOLVENTA offices in Berlin.
